//What is #include<iostream>?
//"	<iostream> is a header file. This file defines the cin, cout, cerr and clog objects, which corresponds to the standard input stream, the standard output stream, the un-buffered standard error stream, and the buffered standard error stream, respectively.
//"	Lines beginning with a hash sign (#) are directives for the preprocessor.
//"	#include<iostream> tells the preprocessor to include the iostream standard file.

//#include<iostream> CODE:

//Why  'using namespace std'  is/will be used?

//-	All elements of the standard C++ library are declared within what is called a namespace, the namespace with the name std.
//-	So in order to access its functionality we declare with this expression that we will be using this entities.

//What does 'int(main)' means?
//-	This line corresponds to the beginning of the definition of the main function.
//-	The main function is the point by where all c++ programs starts their execution, independently of its location within the source code.
